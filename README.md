## 📖 Abstract

Prostate cancer (PCa) has become a global health concern as it is classified among the deadliest cancers in men, and the death rate is rising in an alarming way even in developed countries. Studies have shown that men of African descent are more likely to develop PCa at a younger age—factors that are less addressed in current clinical practices.  

In this regard, we developed **“Proman”**, an AI-based solution that ensures the delivery of individualized, high-quality, and evidence-based care for people with PCa. Furthermore, it applies machine learning algorithms to assist health professionals in managing PCa by making appropriate decisions to provide consistent care to patients.  

We have obtained satisfactory results showing that AI techniques have great potential to improve current clinical practices by providing a second opinion to health professionals. We believe that our work will contribute to clinical recommendations that consider the unique characteristics of the African race.
